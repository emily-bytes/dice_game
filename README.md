Dice Game 

This program uses a loaded die, which is like a regular six-sided dice, but 30% of the time the computer's die will roll a 6 (the other 70% of the time it will be a uniform random value between 1 and 6), and 30% of the time the user's die will roll a 1 (the other 70% of the time it will be a uniform random value between 1 and 6).

To simulate this, you will write a class, LoadedDie and use that instead of Die. A LoadedDie is always six-sided so you can dispense with the number of sides feature of the Die class in the book. Other than that, you can model your LoadedDie class on the book's class, but you'll have to have slightly different roll method and constructor.
